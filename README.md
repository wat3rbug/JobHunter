# JobHunter
This application shows that I can write applications.  It's a weekend project.  I may decide to add more as things go.  All it does is help me keep track of what jobs I have applied for during my job ssearch.  There is a lot of ludcirious stuff going on in the world of software development.  There appears to be a wide stretch between capable individuals such as myself, and others.  It's not uncommon to want 5-6 years of experience for a language that has only existed for 4 years.  My guess is that employers are hedging their bets to get good people, when it doesn't really do anything except exclude good people.  I didn't put a lot of bells and whistles on this project cause it is really just an exercise.

Things learned.
1.  Java interfaces have syntacical differences from C# interfaces, but they still provide contracts between objects.
2.  Object/Listener design pattern isn't well implemented as compared to Objective-C's version.  The istener is a concrete class, and so implementation becomes more of an issue.  I got around this, but it is not the most elegant solution.
3.  I was clearly designing this as I went.  There are some linked list objects, which are not used.  I didn't know at the time whether I would use them and they are simple to create.
4. The layout and spacing isn't the best, as I added 2 more fields during the process.
